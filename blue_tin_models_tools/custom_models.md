# Custom Character Models

The main reason why we are releasing these models open source is so people can make their own models or customize the existing models.

Making a new model should be fairly simple.

What you don't need: 

  * You don't even need a rigged skeleton. (It will work without - of course you can't pose it)
  * You don't need a standard skeleton. (You can pose any bones. So you could have a rigged dog.)
  * You don't need blend shapes / morph targets.
  * You can have any blend shapes you want (It will load them in dynamically)

What you need:

  * A model with a mesh
  * A single material with a single texture

So some custom examples:

  * A character downloaded off the internet with no rig and you don't need to pose it
  * A dog - Who's a good boy?<br>  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/441117/50732776-b5b2e700-114f-11e9-8877-d4b160e30389.png" width="300">
  * A snake
  * A monster
  * A person with very specific morph targets
  * A very specific model with lots of detail
  * A model based on one of these models you slightly edited
