# Blue Tin Fox Models

Shot Generator is used by V-Sekai to easily set up shots using 3D characters, objects, lights, and cameras.

Shot Generator uses 3D models as characters. This repository is the open source of those models as canonical Blender .blend files, and the exports used in shot generator: gltf.
