## Create All of the LOD Models

1. Name main model something like `male-youth-LOD0`
2. Duplicate the main model `(Shift + D, Escape)`
3. Remove shape keys on the duplicate
4. Add a decimate modifier to the duplicate
   * with `symmetry`
5. Add shrinkwrap modifier
   * select the target of `LOD0`
6. Copy shrinkwrap 2 times
7. Rename each shrinkwrap:
   * `Skinny`
   * `Muscular`
   * `Obese`
8. Duplicate 3 more times so you have 4 models and rename to:
   * `male-youth-LOD1`
   * `male-youth-LOD2`
   * `male-youth-LOD3`
   * `male-youth-LOD4`
9. Apply decimate modifier to each:
   * LOD0 - 13,000 polys (100%)
   * LOD1 - 6,000 polys (44%)
   * LOD2 - 2,000 polys 
   * LOD3 - 750 polys
   * LOD4 - 400 polys
10. And apply

## Create the Shape Keys by Shrink Wrapping

1. Make sure LOD0 model has the shapekeys named:
   * Skinny
   * Muscular
   * Obese
2. LOOP: For each shape key (Skinny, Muscular, Obese):
   * Click LOD0: Shape keys
     * Turn all down to 0
     * Turn the correct shape key (Skinny, Muscular, Obese) up to 1.0
   * Click on LOD1-4: Modifiers
     * Apply correct Shrink Wrap modifier as Shape key
3. Repeat for each LOD1+ and Shape key
